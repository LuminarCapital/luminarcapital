<h4>Security</h4>
<p>Luminar takes reasonable steps to safeguard your personal information through physical, electronic, and operational policies and practices. Data can only be read or written through defined service access points, the use of which is password-protected. The physical security of the data is achieved through a combination of network firewalls (there is no direct communication allowed between the database server and the Internet) and servers with operating systems, all housed in a secure facility.</p>
<p>Access to the system is controlled. Employees are granted access to personal information on a need-to-know basis in order to perform a specific job (for example, billing or customer service). We use encryption to protect your personal information transmitted online, as well as offline. When we contact you about your account or to confirm a funds transfer, we only reference the last four digits of your social security number. The computers/servers in which we store personally identifiable information are kept in a secure environment.
We will also ensure the proper disposal of your personal information—regardless of the source.</p>
<h4>User Access</h4>
<p>If your personal information changes, or if you no longer want updates or to be contacted for new products, you may correct, update, amend, delete/remove or deactivate your contact information by emailing our customer support at <a href="mailto:support@luminarcapital.com">support@luminarcapital.com</a> or by contacting us by telephone or postal mail at the contact information listed below. We will update your file within 30 calendar days.</p>
<h4>Data Retention</h4>
<p>We will retain your information for as long as your account is active and thereafter as long as reasonably useful for internal purposes to improve our services and also to provide you with information in the future regarding our and our partners’ products and services.

<h4>Information Posted To Our Site</h4>
<p>We may, from time to time, allow users to post information to our Site, such as comments or testimonials. Any information that you post to our Site becomes public information and may be viewable by other users, as well as visitors to our Site (this is not true of uploaded documents as part of the funding process). In addition, your name, as well as other optional information you choose to submit along with the information you post, will be publicly displayed. We are not responsible for the privacy of any information that you choose to post to our Site, or for the accuracy of any information contained in those postings. We cannot prevent such information from being used by others in a manner that may violate this Privacy Policy, the law, or your personal privacy. Your posting of any content to any of the Site is subject to our Terms of Service.</p>
<h4>Third-Party Links</h4>
<p>At times, our Site may contain links to other, third-party websites. Any access to and use of such linked websites is not governed by this Privacy Policy but, instead, is governed by the privacy policies of those third-party websites. We are not responsible for the information practices of such third-party websites.</p>
<h4>International Users</h4>
<p>The Site is hosted in the United States. If you are accessing the Site from outside the United States, by providing your information to the Site, you are consenting to and authorizing the transfer of your information to the United States for storage, use, processing, maintenance, and onward transfer of such information to other entities regardless of their location in accordance with this Privacy Policy and our Terms of Service. You are also consenting to the application of United States law in all matters concerning the Site.</p>
<h4>Session Time Outs</h4>
<p>We also employ session time-outs to protect your account. You will be logged out of the Site automatically after a specified period of inactivity. This time-out feature reduces the risk of others being able to access your account if you leave your computer unattended.</p>
<h4>What You Can Do To Protect Your Personal Information</h4>
<p>In addition to our own efforts, you can take several precautions to protect the security of your computer and personal information. For instance, you should create and use a complex password, using numbers, a combination of small and large capital letters, and special characters. You should avoid using any information that others can easily learn about you, such as your mother’s maiden name, a family member’s name or birthday. We also recommend that you change your password frequently. You should never share your password with anyone, or leave it written down in an unsecure area.</p>

<p>You can also install and regularly update antivirus and firewall software to protect your computer or device from external attacks by malicious users. If you use a computer that can be accessed in a public area (e.g., library, coffee shop, etc.), we recommend that you take special precautions to protect the security of your account and personal information. When you are finished visiting our Site, you should log out completely, close the browser window and clear the browser’s cache files.</p>

<p>You should also be aware of fraudulent attempts to gain access to your account information known as “phishing.” Phishing is a tactic used by scammers to lure people to a phony website through the use of a genuine-looking email purporting to be from a legitimate company. Either in the email itself or on this fake website site, scammers will ask for login information to gain access to people’s accounts and withdraw their money. Luminar will never ask you for your login information in the context of any email. In general, you can protect yourself against phishing by never providing login or personal information via an email.</p>
