<p>Access to the system is controlled. Employees are granted access to personal information on a need-to-know basis in order to perform a specific job (for example, billing or customer service). We use encryption to protect your personal information transmitted online, as well as offline. When we contact you about your account or to confirm a funds transfer, we only reference the last four digits of your social security number. The computers/servers in which we store personally identifiable information are kept in a secure environment.
We will also ensure the proper disposal of your personal information—regardless of the source.</p>

<p>If your personal information changes, or if you no longer want updates or to be contacted for new products, you may correct, update, amend, delete/remove or deactivate your contact information by emailing our customer support at <a href="mailto:support@luminarcapital.com">support@luminarcapital.com</a> or by contacting us by telephone or postal mail at the contact information listed below. We will update your file within 30 calendar days.</p>
<h4>Data Retention</h4>
<p>We will retain your information for as long as your account is active and thereafter as long as reasonably useful for internal purposes to improve our services and also to provide you with information in the future regarding our and our partners’ products and services.

In addition, your name, as well as other optional information you choose to submit along with the information you post, will be publicly displayed. We are not responsible for the privacy of any information that you choose to post to our Site, or for the accuracy of any information contained in those postings. We cannot prevent such information from being used by others in a manner that may violate this Privacy Policy, the law, or your personal privacy. Your posting of any content to any of the Site is subject to our Terms of Service.</p>
<h4>Third-Party Links</h4>
<p>At times, our Site may contain links to other, third-party websites. Any access to and use of such linked websites is not governed by this Privacy Policy but, instead, is governed by the privacy policies of those third-party websites. We are not responsible for the information practices of such third-party websites.</p>
<h4>International Users</h4>
<p>The Site is hosted in the United States. If you are accessing the Site from outside the United States, by providing your information to the Site, you are consenting to and authorizing the transfer of your information to the United States for storage, use, processing, maintenance, and onward transfer of such information to other entities regardless of their location in accordance with this Privacy Policy and our Terms of Service. You are also consenting to the application of United States law in all matters concerning the Site.</p>
<h4>Session Time Outs</h4>
<p>We also employ session time-outs to protect your account. You will be logged out of the Site automatically after a specified period of inactivity. This time-out feature reduces the risk of others being able to access your account if you leave your computer unattended.</p>
<h4>What You Can Do To Protect Your Personal Information</h4>
<p>In addition to our own efforts, you can take several precautions to protect the security of your computer and personal information. For instance, you should create and use a complex password, using numbers, a combination of small and large capital letters, and special characters. You should avoid using any information that others can easily learn about you, such as your mother’s maiden name, a family member’s name or birthday. We also recommend that you change your password frequently. You should never share your password with anyone, or leave it written down in an unsecure area.</p>

<p>You can also install and regularly update antivirus and firewall software to protect your computer or device from external attacks by malicious users. If you use a computer that can be accessed in a public area (e.g., library, coffee shop, etc.), we recommend that you take special precautions to protect the security of your account and personal information. When you are finished visiting our Site, you should log out completely, close the browser window and clear the browser’s cache files.</p>

<p>You should also be aware of fraudulent attempts to gain access to your account information known as “phishing.” Phishing is a tactic used by scammers to lure people to a phony website through the use of a genuine-looking email purporting to be from a legitimate company. Either in the email itself or on this fake website site, scammers will ask for login information to gain access to people’s accounts and withdraw their money. Luminar will never ask you for your login information in the context of any email. In general, you can protect yourself against phishing by never providing login or personal information via an email.</p>
<h4>Privacy Policy For California Residents</h4>

<h4>I. Why Do We Collect Your Personal Information?</h4>
<p>Luminar Capital  provides business financing to small businesses. In order to provide small business financing, we must collect information regarding the business as well as personal information from the business owner(s). Without obtaining this information, Luminar Capital  would be unable to provide financing as it would not have the information necessary to underwrite a request for financing. Furthermore, Luminar Capital  collects information regarding the business and personal information about the business owner(s) in order to improve the customer experience on our website, customer journey and client portal. Luminar Capital  also collects this data in order to assist the business in obtaining business financing from Luminar Capital . The information collected is kept indefinitely, unless we receive a request to delete from the client.</p>
<h4>II. What Personal Information Do We Collect?</h4>
<p>Luminar Capital  collects and maintains all information that the business owner(s) submits to Luminar Capital . This may include sensitive personal information about the business (e.g. business name, business address, business telephone number, business bank statements, credit card processing statements, federal tax identification number, financial statements, tax returns, email addresses, etc.) as well as sensitive personal information submitted by the business owner(s) to Luminar Capital (e.g. name, address, date of birth, driver’s license information, social security number, credit report information, telephone number, email addresses, etc.).</p>
<p>Luminar Capital  may also collect sensitive personal information about the business applicant and owner(s) which Luminar Capital receives from third parties. This information may be obtained by Luminar Capital from a third party that refers the business and business owner(s) to Luminar Capital and such information may include everything listed above that Luminar Capital  collects itself from businesses and their owners. This information may also be obtained by Luminar Capital from other third parties such as tax reporting services, bank account verification services, bank activity information providers, credit reporting services, landlords and neighbors, telephone number verification services, email verification services, IP address verification services, business status services, and credit card processing companies. Luminar Capital may disclose the aforementioned categories of personal information to third parties in order for third parties to provide business financing to the business or in order for third parties to assist Luminar Capital in its servicing or collection of past due accounts.</p>
<p>Luminar Capital also collects and maintains personal information that is indirectly provided to us by visiting our website(s) or any other online pages that we may maintain (whether accessed by computer or mobile phone). Specifically, Luminar Capital collects categories of information including: (i) information that is integral to maintaining the operation of our systems, which, for instance, helps us track which webpage you are viewing; (ii) marketing related scripts and cookies, such as how you got to our website; and (iii) user interaction scripts and cookies, which help us gather information on how you interact with our website. Furthermore, this includes information such as IP addresses, browser information, any other information collected via cookies, and geolocation. We collect this information on visitors in order to improve the client experience and ensure that the client is able to pick up where they left off during a visit to our website.</p>
<h4>III. Do We Sell Personal Information?</h4>
<p>Luminar Capital  does not sell any personal information to third parties. Luminar Capital  may share personal information to its service providers who have a need to know the information to assist Luminar Capital  and to third parties who will assist a small business applicant in obtaining financing for the business and will do so only with the business’s express written or verbal authorization.</p>
<p>Luminar Capital only provides business financing to businesses whose owners are eighteen (18) years or older and therefore does not collect nor sell the personal information of minors.</p>
<h4>IV. Right To Know And Right To Access</h4>
<p>Under the CCPA, a business owner residing in California has the right to request that Luminar Capital disclose what personal information it has collected, used, or disclosed about the business owner over the past 12 months. A business owner may submit a request to know up to twice a year, free of charge. A business owner that submits personal information to Luminar Capital can either personally or through an authorized agent, request the disclosure of the personal information that Luminar Capital collected and maintained within the previous twelve (12) months.</p>
